# Advent of Code

Count down to Christmas with daily [programming puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/) 🎄.

I favor code efficiency and readability over code golf and leaderboard (which is too competitive for my current level to gain a foothold 🏋️‍♂️).
Besides, I strive to cover as many edge cases as I can, even the ones that don't appear in the sample input.

Each script reads the corresponding text file in the same folder as input, e.g., `day01.py` reads `input01.txt`.
